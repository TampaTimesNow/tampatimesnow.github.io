                <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>AMPA — A coordinated operation involving federal agents and the Hillsborough Sheriff's department caused significant disruption in North Tampa Tuesday morning, as authorities executed an unannounced search warrant at a technical support operations center on W Sligh Avenue.</p>
                
                <p>Witnesses reported seeing several dozen Hillsborough Sheriff's deputies arrive at the location around 8:15 a.m. Agents in tactical gear were seen securing all exits before entering the main lobby. By 9:00 a.m., a wide perimeter was established, blocking off two blocks of commuter traffic.</p>
                
                <p>“We were just starting our shift when the alarms went off,” said one employee, who requested anonymity. “They told us to leave our computers and exit through the front. No one would tell us what was happening.”</p>

                <blockquote>"Public safety is our priority. We are assisting federal partners in an ongoing, active investigation." — HSD Spokesperson.</blockquote>

                <p>While the specific nature of the warrant remains under seal, sources close to the investigation suggest it may be related to a multi-state evaluation of data security protocols and consumer privacy. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment, stating only that there is "no immediate threat to the public."</p>

                <p>Local residents are advised to avoid the area near N Dale Mabry HWY and Pine Crest Manor BLVD until at least 3:00 p.m. this afternoon.</p>
